This project utilizes a dataset of rental bike usage, which includes information on the number of bikes rented at each hour, the location of the rental station, and the weather conditions at the time of rental. The aim of this project is to use regression analysis to predict the required bike count at each hour, enabling rental bike providers to maintain a stable supply of bikes and enhance mobility comfort for users.

To achieve this goal, the project will involve several steps. First, we will preprocess the dataset to ensure that it is clean and organized for analysis. This will involve handling missing data, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

Next, we will explore the dataset using statistical analysis and visualization techniques to identify trends and patterns in bike rental demand. This will help us to identify the key variables that affect bike rental demand, such as the time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and location of the rental station.

After identifying the relevant variables, we will use regression analysis to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the number of bikes required at each hour. We will use linear regression to build and evaluate different models.

Overall, this project aims to provide a solution for the challenge of maintaining a stable supply of rental bikes in urban cities. By utilizing regression analysis and machine learning techniques, we can develop a predictive model that enables rental bike providers to maintain a reliable supply of bikes, reducing waiting times and enhancing mobility comfort for users.
