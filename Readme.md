This project leverages a comprehensive dataset of rental bike usage, encompassing details such as hourly bike rental counts and corresponding weather conditions. The objective of this project is to employ regression analysis techniques to forecast the required number of bikes for each hour. By doing so, rental bike providers can ensure a consistent supply of bikes and improve the overall user experience in terms of mobility convenience.

To accomplish this, I implemented the XGBoost Regressor, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to make accurate predictions. Additionally, I developed a Flask application to serve the trained model, allowing users to access the bike count predictions through an intuitive web interface. This combination of regression analysis and model deployment facilitates effective decision-making and resource management for rental bike providers.
